Running the calculations to perform these analyses is quite resource intensive
(eight hours or more for a reliable result per opinion poll). Financial help
to move these calculations out to the cloud is always welcome. If you're a
medium that would be interested in getting exclusive results and insights, I'm
sure we can work something out!
